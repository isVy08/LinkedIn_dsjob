This is because there is a big difference between developing research applications for oneself in R/Shiny vs. creating robust tools for large numbers of users and because no one technology platform does everything well. At ESSA we also have deep historic investments in award winning .NET solutions, and .NET continues to deliver a vast ecosystem of tools and technologies supporting integration with JavaScript frameworks that allow developers to sew together more beautiful and functional technological quilts. If you are intrigued, dig into the key requirements for the position here: https://essa.com/careers/."

Yup, you read that right – we are looking for a “scientist-first” hire. The utopian candidate will also have a second degree or diploma in web technology development. To help set you on the path to becoming the multi-faceted decision support tool expert our client’s and the world needs, we are offering a highly unique, paid professional development training incentive.

10786,In House Consulting With High Impact Projects and A Genuine Work-Life Balance 
10787,In House Consulting With High Impact Projects and A Genuine Work-Life Balance
10788,"1 . Genuine Work Life Balance - This job has travel, but it’s way less than in a normal Consulting job.  If you’re in Consulting now this is your chance to get your personal life back.  The average travel outside of Munich is 20-25%. "
10789,1 . Genuine Work Life Balance
10790,2 . Real Big Data Projects with high visibility -  You’ll mostly be project managing technical Big Data projects.   
10791,2 . Real Big Data Projects with high visibility
10792,3 . Fast growing Team - Since Nov 2015 the team have grown from 90 people to 250 people.  Not bad growth inside a couple of years.  A business unit only grows that fast in a large company if it has C-level backing and it's delivering.   
10793,3 . Fast growing Team
10794,4 . An unbelievably high level of Stakeholder Trust - An enviable track record of hundreds of successful Internal Consulting projects has added billions to the company's bottom line.   This means your internal clients will respect you more than outside consultants.  You work for the same company as your clients so they know you’ll put their interests first.  No them and us routine here. 
10795,4 . An unbelievably high level of Stakeholder Trust
10796,5 . Award Winning - Several times in recent years they have been awarded the Best In House Consultancy in Germany by the prestigious WirtschaftsWoche’s Best in Consulting awards.  So you know you’ll be working in a high performing team. 
10797,5 . Award Winning
10798,6 . Variety of Work -  The company has many subsidiaries delivering 100’s of products and services.  This means every project is different and you’ll constantly be dealing with new challenges.  It’s impossible for you to get bored in this job.    You’ll continually be learning new things at a rapid rate that’s just not possible in a Non-Consulting job.   
10799,6 . Variety of Work
10800,7 . You’ll be learning from the best - The partner leading this group previously spent 4 yrs at McKinsey - There isn’t much he doesn’t know about delivering impactful Consulting programs.   You couldn’t be in better hands. 
10801,7 . You’ll be learning from the best
10802,8 . You get to see the Long term Impact of your work - In most Consulting jobs you complete the project and then move onto the next job without knowing what happened further down the road.  Here you won’t get that.  Whilst you’re eating your cakes in the canteen expect stakeholders of previous projects to come up to you.  They’ll be thanking you for the successful project you delivered long after you’re gone.  This actually happened when I was there.  I was half way through gobbling my second cake at the time.

15542,"About Nielsen, division Pointlogic"
15543,econometrics / operations research / mathematics.
15544," Accelerated probabilistic programmingPointlogic uses probabilistic programming extensively for performing various types of analytical inference; currently that inference is performed in Stan. Probabilistic programming is a tool for statistical modeling, closely linked to performing Bayesian Statistics - it seeks to describe probabilistic models and then perform inference in those models.One of our current technical challenges is that our models are computationally expensive and we do not have satisfactory options for reducing the run time. The goal of this project is to evaluate the various algorithms and technical frameworks available for performing probabilistic programming.We have a few potential avenues that we would like to explore but are open to other ideas as well:We currently use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, another option is to use Variational inference – which gives approximate answers but in a more timely fashion. Evaluating new frameworks for Pointlogic specific models. Recent frameworks include; Edward (which uses Google’s TensorFlow as a backend) & Pyro from Uber AI labs. Use of GPUs for large matrix calculations or exploring distributional computing through systems such as MPI. General reparameterizations to the model structure that allow for more efficient sampling. flex-12 Modelling advertising effectiveness under uncertaintyThe goal of this project is to review a current component of modelling using survey data at Pointlogic. Our respondent level brand health models almostWe Have Many Potential Areas For Exploration HereCurrently the Contact Estimation & Modelling are two separate procedures – would there be added value in having a single procedure that performs the operation concurrently? Is using the expectation of number of contact sufficient or is there enough added value in incorporating more of the uncertainty around the number of contacts to justify the added complexity and computational overhead? Is there a bias in estimated effects of media by channel after Contact Estimation? If so, how large is it and can we construct a methodology to correct for any bias? flex-12 Machine learning for dimension reductionIn many projects, Pointlogic uses dimension reduction in order to reduce the number of features used in a model. The most common technique used is principal components. In this project, we will use machine-learning methods (e.g. auto-encoders) to do dimension reduction and compare the performance with commonly used methods.For Media Measurement (panel) Integration, The Following Example Of a 1-1 Fusion Is IllustrativeData fusion is a method of integrating data sets using statistical analytics and modeling in order to create a single data set that incorporates the attributes from both underlying sources. The ‘integrated’ dataset allows us to make analysis that require variables from both sides.Data Set 1: TV panel. This is a data set of television viewing for a group of people. This data set includes demographics (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity, people in the home, income), along with detailed television viewing behavior, and information about computer device ownership and usage behavior. We will let the TV panel be the recipient data set. Data Set 2: Radio panel. This is a data set of listening behavior for a separate group of panelists (not in Data set 1). This data set also includes demographics, some measurement of TV and most importantly detailed listening behavior. Let the radio panel be the donor data set. Data Set 3: The fused data set. The integrated data set that has the original panelists from the TV panel but these panelists have been assigned listening behaviors that came from the radio panelTo create Data Set 3, we identify like-variables within both Data Set 1 and Data Set 2, which are called linking variables. Using statistical analysis to understand how each of these variables correlates to both viewing of television and listening behavior, we establish importance weights for each variable, including which variables must match exactly between both data sets (always age/gender and various demographics traits).When the linking variables and their importance are established, we can define a distance function between respondents. The next step, linking donors to recipients while minimizing distances is known in Operations Research as a generalized assignment problem and it is well studied. Standard algorithms can solve the assignment problem very efficiently. The combined dataset can be used to estimate the overlap between TV stations and radio stations, or the joined reach of a cross-media campaign.flex-12 Outlier detection in TV panelsIn many countries, Nielsen is responsible for providing TV ratings data: information on how many people watched specific shows on television. These TV ratings are considered a ‘currency’ as advertisers buying spots for TV advertising pay based on the amount of people watching during that time. Therefore having robust, reliable ratings is crucial for Nielsen and the TV buying market. TV ratings are measured via a panel study; the size of this panel varies by country. The aim of this project is to identify individuals that demonstrate not natural viewing behavior with the use of sophisticated indicators that should be set.  Specifically the task is to define a scientific methodology and tools to detect suspicious individuals. Based on this set objective indicators to conclude about provedConsiderations to be taken into account: instructions given to individuals by third parties to watch something could be not constant in time and could be different for different channels, could be quite sophisticated aiming not to be revealed in easy way.The aim is to explore opportunities of machine learning capabilities and various statistical methods. Available information is viewing data for each individual by each channel and listing of demographic characteristics on daily base. Viewing data is available on viewing statements level. Analysis should be performed along whole period of panel existence with regular periodicity in order to detect false behavior individuals in-time manner upon their appearing. The moment when household is disclosed and contacted by third parties with instruction to watch something in specific is not known, it could be in the beginning of household inclusion into the panel or any day during the whole period of presence in the panel.flex-12 Swarm optimization in MarketingThe optimization problem has 10,000’s decision variables (real-valued), linear restrictions and a non-linear objective function, that is very computational demanding to evaluate. The application is about planning an advertising campaign. The decision variables correspondent to budgets allocated to a large set of media and the objective function represents the ROI of the campaign.The main reason why we are interested in particle swarm optimization is that it can take advantage of a parallel computing environment. Working on this project, you will be implementing and tuning a number of variations of the algorithm, and evaluating these on a benchmark set of optimization problems.flex-12 Wisdom of the crowd Surveys about media consumption behavior are the core of many of our products  . The biggest and most time-consuming part for respondents are questions related to the reach and frequency of specific media channels. Due to the large amount of channels, we are forced to ask respondents only about a subset of channels. Experiments show that we are able to collect much more/accurate information when asking people to assess group behavior rather than individual behavior.The goal of this project is to combine two interviewing techniques, which will allow respondents to describe their media behavior in a non-traditional way.  The first experimental treatment introduces previously collected data about media consumption, and will ask the respondent to make corrections to match this consumption with their own consumption.   The second treatment includes questions that ask respondents about the average media consumption of their peer group rather than themselves. By doing so we can assess respondents’ meta-knowledge about the population distribution rather than their own and correct for individual errors. This project includes combining these two treatments in a two by two experimental design and comparing the results with data collected by our traditional questionnaire design. Note: this project requires primary data collection and funding, these considerations can be done only after submitting a complete research proposal. flex-12Your profileCurrently enrolled in a Master in Computer science, Econometrics, Mathematics, or other quantitative MSc; Some experience in R and/or Python programming, classification models and theory of simulation; Good command in spoken and written English; Available for at least 20 hours per week; Available for a period of at least 6 months; Residing in the Netherlands.

15547," Machine learning for dimension reductionIn many projects, Pointlogic uses dimension reduction in order to reduce the number of features used in a model. The most common technique used is principal components. In this project, we will use machine-learning methods (e.g. auto-encoders) to do dimension reduction and compare the performance with commonly used methods.For Media Measurement (panel) Integration, The Following Example Of a 1-1 Fusion Is IllustrativeData fusion is a method of integrating data sets using statistical analytics and modeling in order to create a single data set that incorporates the attributes from both underlying sources. The ‘integrated’ dataset allows us to make analysis that require variables from both sides.Data Set 1: TV panel. This is a data set of television viewing for a group of people. This data set includes demographics (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity, people in the home, income), along with detailed television viewing behavior, and information about computer device ownership and usage behavior. We will let the TV panel be the recipient data set. Data Set 2: Radio panel. This is a data set of listening behavior for a separate group of panelists (not in Data set 1). This data set also includes demographics, some measurement of TV and most importantly detailed listening behavior. Let the radio panel be the donor data set. Data Set 3: The fused data set. The integrated data set that has the original panelists from the TV panel but these panelists have been assigned listening behaviors that came from the radio panelTo create Data Set 3, we identify like-variables within both Data Set 1 and Data Set 2, which are called linking variables. Using statistical analysis to understand how each of these variables correlates to both viewing of television and listening behavior, we establish importance weights for each variable, including which variables must match exactly between both data sets (always age/gender and various demographics traits).When the linking variables and their importance are established, we can define a distance function between respondents. The next step, linking donors to recipients while minimizing distances is known in Operations Research as a generalized assignment problem and it is well studied. Standard algorithms can solve the assignment problem very efficiently. The combined dataset can be used to estimate the overlap between TV stations and radio stations, or the joined reach of a cross-media campaign.flex-12 Outlier detection in TV panelsIn many countries, Nielsen is responsible for providing TV ratings data: information on how many people watched specific shows on television. These TV ratings are considered a ‘currency’ as advertisers buying spots for TV advertising pay based on the amount of people watching during that time. Therefore having robust, reliable ratings is crucial for Nielsen and the TV buying market. TV ratings are measured via a panel study; the size of this panel varies by country. The aim of this project is to identify individuals that demonstrate not natural viewing behavior with the use of sophisticated indicators that should be set.  Specifically the task is to define a scientific methodology and tools to detect suspicious individuals. Based on this set objective indicators to conclude about provedConsiderations to be taken into account: instructions given to individuals by third parties to watch something could be not constant in time and could be different for different channels, could be quite sophisticated aiming not to be revealed in easy way.The aim is to explore opportunities of machine learning capabilities and various statistical methods. Available information is viewing data for each individual by each channel and listing of demographic characteristics on daily base. Viewing data is available on viewing statements level. Analysis should be performed along whole period of panel existence with regular periodicity in order to detect false behavior individuals in-time manner upon their appearing. The moment when household is disclosed and contacted by third parties with instruction to watch something in specific is not known, it could be in the beginning of household inclusion into the panel or any day during the whole period of presence in the panel.flex-12 Swarm optimization in MarketingThe optimization problem has 10,000’s decision variables (real-valued), linear restrictions and a non-linear objective function, that is very computational demanding to evaluate. The application is about planning an advertising campaign. The decision variables correspondent to budgets allocated to a large set of media and the objective function represents the ROI of the campaign.The main reason why we are interested in particle swarm optimization is that it can take advantage of a parallel computing environment. Working on this project, you will be implementing and tuning a number of variations of the algorithm, and evaluating these on a benchmark set of optimization problems.flex-12 Wisdom of the crowd Surveys about media consumption behavior are the core of many of our products  . The biggest and most time-consuming part for respondents are questions related to the reach and frequency of specific media channels. Due to the large amount of channels, we are forced to ask respondents only about a subset of channels. Experiments show that we are able to collect much more/accurate information when asking people to assess group behavior rather than individual behavior.The goal of this project is to combine two interviewing techniques, which will allow respondents to describe their media behavior in a non-traditional way.  The first experimental treatment introduces previously collected data about media consumption, and will ask the respondent to make corrections to match this consumption with their own consumption.   The second treatment includes questions that ask respondents about the average media consumption of their peer group rather than themselves. By doing so we can assess respondents’ meta-knowledge about the population distribution rather than their own and correct for individual errors. This project includes combining these two treatments in a two by two experimental design and comparing the results with data collected by our traditional questionnaire design. Note: this project requires primary data collection and funding, these considerations can be done only after submitting a complete research proposal. flex-12Your profileCurrently enrolled in a Master in Computer science, Econometrics, Mathematics, or other quantitative MSc; Some experience in R and/or Python programming, classification models and theory of simulation; Good command in spoken and written English; Available for at least 20 hours per week; Available for a period of at least 6 months; Residing in the Netherlands.
